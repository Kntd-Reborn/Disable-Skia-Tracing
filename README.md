# Disable SkiaGL Tracing

Disable traces in skiagl rendering to avoid excessive performance/power usage.

## Requirement
- Android
- Magisk 23+ or KernelSU 

## Description
Disabling traces in skiagl can improve performance if you use skiagl in your rendering type.

`Trace` is a process that tracks and monitors the activity of a system or other process.

`Trace` should not be needed for devices that are no longer used for development or production release and will only use performance.

So, this module disables `trace` on skia rendering via resetprop in magisk.

## Installation
Just Install on Magisk or KernelSU and then reboot.
