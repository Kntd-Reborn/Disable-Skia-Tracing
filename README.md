# Disable SkiaGL Tracing
Disable traces in skiagl rendering to avoid excessive performance/power usage.

## Requirement
- Android
- Magisk 23+

## Description
Disabling traces in skiagl can improve performance if you use skiagl in your rendering type.

Trace is a process that tracks and monitors the activity of a system or other process.

Trace should not be needed for devices that are no longer used for development or production release and will only use performance.

So, this module disables trace on skia rendering via resetprop in magisk.
