# Disable Skia Tracing ⚡
- Disable traces in skiagl rendering to avoid excessive performance/power usage.

## Requirement 💻
- Android
- Magisk 23+ or KernelSU 

## Download ✅
- [Pling](https://www.pling.com/p/2109726/)

## Description 📁
Disable tracing in skiagl can reduce performance usage for `trace` activity if you use skiagl in your rendering type.

`Trace` is a process that tracks and monitors the activity of a system or other process.

`Trace` should not be needed for devices that are no longer used for development or production release and will only use performance.

## How does it work? 🛠️
- So, this module disables `trace` for skiagl rendering via resetprop in magisk.
